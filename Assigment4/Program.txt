1.What type would you choose for the following “numbers”?
A person’s telephone number -  string 
A person’s height-            double 
A person’s age-                int 

A person’s gender (Male, Female, Prefer Not To Answer)-   enum 
 A person’s salary - decimal
 A book’s ISBN - string
 A book’s price- decimal
A book’s shipping weight- double
A country’s population- long
The number of stars in the universe- ulong 
The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the United Kingdom (up to about 50,000 employees per business)-ushort 

2.What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is boxing and unboxing?

In value type variable directly contains data value within its own memory space.Unlike value types, a reference type doesn't store its value directly.
Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored.
In other words, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.
Boxing is an implicit conversion of a value type to the type object or to any interface type implemented
by value type
//Ex.
//int i = 123;
//object o = i;
Unhoxing - Unboxing is an explicit conversion
from the type object to a value type or from an interface type
to a value type that implements the interface.
//Ex.
//int k = 123; //value type
//object h = k; //boxing
//int j = (int)h;//unboxing

3.What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET

Managed resources basically mean anything managed by the CLR (example: any of your managed objects).
Unmanaged resources typically mean native resources that are created and lifetime managed outside the CLR

4.Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?

manages the allocation and release of memory for  application



Controlling Flow and Converting Types Test your Knowledge

1.What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
Throws DivideByZeroException
2.What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
The result of arithmetic operations with those types can be one of special values that represent infinity and not-a-number:
3.What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range?
In a checked context, if overflow happens in a constant expression, a compile-time error occurs.
Otherwise, when the operation is performed at run time, an OverflowException is thrown.
In an unchecked context, the result is truncated by discarding any high-order bits that don't fit in the destination type.
4.What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
The result of x++ is the value of x before the operation
The result of ++x is the value of x after the operation
5.What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement?
The break statement: terminates the closest enclosing iteration statement or switch statement.
The continue statement: starts a new iteration of the closest enclosing iteration statement.
The return statement: terminates execution of the function in which it appears and returns control to the caller.Jan
6.What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
It requires 3 parts: the initialization (loop variant), the condition,
and the advancement to the next iteration.
7.What is the difference between the = and == operators?
= assigs value
==compares values 
8.Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
the code will create a for that will check if true is true creating an infinite loop.
9.What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
replaces the default keyword to signify that it should match anything if reached.
10.What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach statement?
The IEnumerable interface



What will happen if this code executes?

int max =500;for(byte i =0; i < max; i++){WriteLine(i);}

We will have error as there is no writeline, we need to use console.writeline.
If we even fix that loop will go infinity as int max is not the same as byte max
